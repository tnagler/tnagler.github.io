    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

    "text": "Thesis supervision\nMy group is supervising theses at both BSc and MSc levels, on a wide range of topics. Our group’s primary interest is in developing statistical methods and studying their theoretical properties. Here’s a non-exhaustive list of areas of particular interest:\n\nCopulas and other dependence models\nFunctional data analysis\nTime series\nProbabilistic machine learning\nStatistical learning theory\nBootstrap, cross-validation, and other resampling methods\n\nTheses about these topics may involve applications to real problems in environmental sciences, engineering, finance, insurance, etc.\nInterested LMU students may send an email with a recent transcript and indication of their interests.\n\nPast highlights\nA. Razawy: Spline Based Estimation for Sufficient Dimension Reduction\nD. Krüger: General vine copula models for stationary multivariate time series\nR. Weber: Value at Risk Estimation with Subset Simulation\nA. Kreuzer: Analysing the spatial dependency among fire danger indices\nA. Brauer: Kernel estimation of conditional copula densities"
